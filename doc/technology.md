# Technologies Used
<br/><br/>
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using sklearn.
<br/>

## Database Storage
We will be using SQL to construct the database, then linking it to pandas later.
<br/>

## Machine Learning
Something about Machine Learning and regressions. 
<br/>

## Dashboard
I'm not totally sure how we will work all of this into a dashboard, maybe use Tableau to create some visualizations once we've put a few more things together.
