# Technologies Used

## Data Extracting
CSV files will be generated through FBref.com and combined through Excel's CSV combining feature.

## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Pandas will be used to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python.

## Database Storage
PgAdmin will be used to run  SQL queries, create tables, and store databases.

## Machine Learning
SciKitLearn is the ML library we'll be using to create a classifier. We will be doing supervised learning on multiple features using SciKitLearn's Linear Regression. I may also have to do some oversampling to compensate for when clubs are relegated for which no data is available. 

## Dashboard
Tableau will be used to create visualizations to present our findings.
