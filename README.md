# Soccer Project
## Overview
Sports statistics is a constantly growing field in the area of data analysis. The introduction of newer technologies yields more precise data, but dynamicity of team sports remains constant. The goal of this project is to use historical scoring data from the Premier League in English Soccer (or Football) to create a model for future scoring trends. Of which the application could be beneficial to creating strategies for teams or for bookies. 
## Results
Some variables we are considering measuring (per year / total):
•	Wins
•	Losses
•	Home Wins
•	Home Draws
•	Home Losses
•	Away Wins
•	Away Draws
•	Away Losses
•	Goal Differential
•	Goals Scored
•	Goals Allowed
•	Expected Goals for (xG)
•	Expected Goals against (xAG)
•	Player Salary
•	Yearly Expenditure
•	Yellow Cards
•	Red Cards
•	Fouls
•	Possession Time
•	Clean Sheets
•	Corners
•	Clearance off Line
Some questions worth exploring:
1. How much does a red card affect the probability of winning a soccer game?
2. Are teams more successful in home or away games?
3. Is there really a best league? Prem vs La Liga vs Serie A vs Bundesliga vs Ligue 1
4. How would “all time great” teams fare in today’s leagues. (Some inspiration -

time )
5. Can you predict the Ballon D’Or Winner?
6. Does wealth = success for a team?
a. What drives the wealth of a team?
7. Can you predict a world cup winner? Is there something in the data
8. Do “better” players = better chance of winning a world cup?
9. Best “worst” team and worst “best” team
10. Do sponsors indicate anything about how well a team performs? Nike vs Adidas vs
Puma etc.
11. Most popular teams in the world based on viewers per game/ ticket sales etc.
12. Does age equate to points?
13. Home grown talent teams - how would they perform?<br/>
Final Topic: Can we predict the outcome of this year’s English Premier League using historical
data on each team’s players and total salary + expenditure in 2022?
